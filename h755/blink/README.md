## Dependencies

* make
    Make utility is required for configuring and building this project. You can install make on linux by running command:

    ```bash
    # for Debian-based Linux distros
    sudo apt install build-essential

    # for macOS 
    xcode-select --install

    # for macOS using brew formulae
    brew install make
    ```

* gcc-arm-none-eabi toolchain
    ARM cross-platform toolchain is required to build applications for arm mcus. Toolchain can be installed by running following command:

    ```bash
    # for Debian-based Linux distros
    sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi

    # for macOS using brew formulae
    brew install arm-none-eabi-gcc
    ```
* STM32 Cube Programmer
    A GUI cum Command Line utility to program any STM32 micro-controller. This tool can be downloaded from https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html

## Project Structure

* `cm4` directory contains all source code which runs on CM4
* `cm7` directory contains all header code which runs on CM7


## Run Locally

Running the project is super easy. Just clone, build, and flash.

### Clone the project

1. Using https

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/csrohit/stm32h7-baremetal.git
    cd stm32h7-baremetal/h755/blink
    ```

2. Using ssh

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:csrohit/stm32h7-baremetal.git
    cd stm32h7-baremetal/h755/blink
    ```
## Configuration

All the configuration required for building this project is given below.

1. Build output directory
    In `Makefile`, output directory can be configured using variable `BUILD_DIR`.

2. Build type
    In `Makefile`, build type can be configured using variable`DEBUG`. Possible values are `Debug` and `Release`.

3. Binary name
    In `CMakeLists.txt`, output binary name can be configured using `project(<binary-name>)` macro.
    ** update above info in `.vscode/launch.json` as well for debugging to work.

## Build

Run following command in terminal to generate flashable binaries for blue pill board. Build files will be written to **Build Output Directory** as configured.

```bash
make all
```

## Flash

1. Connect the USB cable to STM32H7 board.
3. Run following to flash board with binary.

```bash
make flash
```
After running the above command, following logs on terminal are expected
```txt
